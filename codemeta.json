    "description": "The federation registry provides a secure web interface through which service operators can register and manage their OpenID Connect and SAML based service. A federation registry instance can serve multiple tenants and supports different AAI proxy technologies(Keycloak, SimpleSAMLphp, SATOSA (TODO), MITREid Connect). Services can be managed through the portal and are deployed by sending configuration messages to deployment agents that run in parallel with this project. Messages are exchanged using ARGO Messaging Service.",
